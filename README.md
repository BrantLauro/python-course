 A **free** Python course of **Gustavo Guanabara**
 
 **Guanabara** asked us to put color in the terminal for all the exercises using the escape sequence ANSI, so I created a document named **style.py** then created some variables with the ANSI code and import this document into some of my exercises (i will not do this for all the exercises becouse I don't think thats beautiful) and put the variables of **style.py** in my code to make it more readable.
 
 Note: I used 2 external modules: emoji and playsound so make sure you have instaled it on the venv
 
 
 ## Here some examples
 
 **Without style.py**
 
`print('\033[7mHello World!\033[m')`
 
 **With style.py**
 ```
 from ex.style import none, blue

name = input('What is your name? ')
age = int(input('How old are you? '))
weight = float(input('What is your weight? '))

print(f'Hi, {blue}{name}{none} you are {blue}{age}{none} and weighs {blue}{weight}{none} Kg')
```
 
 I really enjoy taking this course. Python is a delicious language.
 
 Coding is my passion than I want to study more and more.
